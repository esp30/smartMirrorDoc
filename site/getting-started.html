        <h3>
          Mihir Patkar <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/6-best-raspberry-pi-smart-mirror-projects-weve-seen-far/">says</a> that the smart mirror of the future won’t just say you’re the prettiest of them all. It’ll also tell you the time, date, weather outside, upcoming calendar appointments, and more. <br><br>

          With the SmartMirror project, we intended to implement a SmartMirror smarter than that description, with 2 major concerns in mind: usability and health.<br><br>

          We realized it could be very interesting to analyze a person's emotion, right from the SmartMirror. This would be very useful for example in situations where patients have to be constantly monitored by medical staff, even when they're at home. <br><br>

          But we also understood that, having in mind the fact the SmartMirror is in fact, a mirror, a touch or keyboard based interaction would not work. Speech recognition was the best solution to provide users a hassle-free experience.<br><br>

          And from these 2 concerns, our SmartMirror proof of concept was born.<br><br>
          
          Want to know how to use it? Just go <a href="https://192.168.160.103:30043/">here</a> and say <i>photo</i>, then <i>photo</i>. You should see an emoji telling you if you're happy or not.
