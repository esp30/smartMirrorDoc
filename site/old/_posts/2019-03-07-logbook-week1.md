*1. Team Meeting 13 February, 13h-14h*

* A. Brainstormed ideas.   
The best idea was a system to control the level of sugar poured into the coffee, useful for the diabetics. We discussed it would be a good idea to expand the idea to other devices, defining the project theme as IoT for Diabetics (provisional name).

*2. Meeting with potential mentor, Jose Alberto Fonseca*  
* A. We invited Jose Alberto Fonseca to be our mentor and explained the idea. He accepted our invitation.
