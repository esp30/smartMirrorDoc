*1. Team Meeting 27 February, 11h-12h*

* Discussed state-of-the-art search.  
Concluded current approach (helping controlling sugar levels in the blood) is not viable having in mind the fact that there already are several solutions doing exactly so, with more precision.

*2. Meeting with Team and Mentor, 27 February, 12h-13h*

* We told the mentor about our team meeting conclusions
* Decided, with the mentor, to change the stakeholder and focus on nutrition for everyone needing to control their diets. 
* Discussed and decided the system's primary use case: creating the plate of food in a self-serving canteen.
* Discussed how the system would work:
    * The user would define its diet and restrictions
    * The user would be given feedback (phone? displays close to the food?) on what aliments to take and how much. 
    * The measurement of the aliments taken would be done by weighting the recipients containing it.
