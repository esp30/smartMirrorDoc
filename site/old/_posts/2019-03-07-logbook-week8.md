*1. Team Meeting 2 April, 14h-19h*
* Discussed Presentation Structure and trained it
  * Start with context, explain architecture and the usage scenarios steps while those steps are being demonstrated by someone
  * Tested current deployed modules 
    * The team spent a lot of time here, because of unpredicted issues regarding the configuration of the used Hotspot (for external restrictions, the UA's network is not a solution)
    * After fixing that, everything is working, ID reader module must be finalized!
  
*2. Mentor Meeting 3 March, 12:40h-13h*
* No formal meeting - usual slot for meeting with mentors was used for the Demo 1
* Small informal meeting after the Demo when it was discussed:
  * The contents of the next releases
  * Possible external collaborations
  * How to involve more the clients in our project
  * Overall state of the project
