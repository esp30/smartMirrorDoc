*1. Team+Mentor Meeting 10 April, 12h-14h*
* Meeting with the Director of the Serviços de Acção Social (SAS) of University of Aveiro and the Nutritionist of the SAS
  * Objective: talk with potential clients
  * Explained the context and what the product can/will do
  * Received feedback from the Director and the Nutritionist. We were told there is interest in the product
      * Receiving metrics on what is being eaten is crucial, having in mind the way stocks are managed. To minimize the stored products, every day products are received - metrics to know what users eat and how much would be crucial to optimize the products to receive everyday. It would also help in managing waste
      * Having a product designed for people who care about their health would be a plus, specially having in mind the major importance the University of Aveiro is giving to sports and sports event. The University of Aveiro wants to host more sports events and having such a service would distinguish them from the rest.
